# DataSense

A data analysis tool built on the MERN stack as a proof of concept. Currently supports uploading of CSV files containing X-Y data pairs and performs simple linear regression.
Click [here](https://data--sense.herokuapp.com) to view the implementation on Heroku.

## Usage

1. Login or Register for an account.
2. Upload a dataset (must be a csv or txt file with X-Y data pairs). Alternatively, load some sample datasets using the built-in feature.
3. View any dataset to see the result of the linear regression analysis.

## Future Development

- Add ability to have multiple variables (e.g. x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>)
- Add more in-depth statistical analysis tools
- Polish the authentication system
